# Hello! I'm Stuart!

Okay, maybe it wasn't Abe, and maybe it was about something else, but you get the point. 

I am starting a blog. 

Why? 

Well, I like a lot of stuff and I want to share with folks who share an affinity said stuff. It's mostly things like coding, data science, Linux, etc. But, I also like reading, writing, cooking, film, hiking, thrift-stores, cycling, kayaking, making things...  

Where will this lead?  I have no clue.

But, since you're already here, check out [[My Daily Notes]].
